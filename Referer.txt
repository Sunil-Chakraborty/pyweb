
Role of "Referer" in HEADERS:

The Referer header in HTTP requests tells the server where the request is coming from. 
Some websites require a proper Referer to prevent direct access to files.

Example: If a file is meant to be accessed only after logging in, 
but the request comes directly from an unknown source, 
the server might return 403 Forbidden.

Best Approach
Default Referer (Google)
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
    "Referer": "https://www.google.com",  # Pretend the request comes from Google search
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "keep-alive"
}

If 403 Forbidden Still Occurs, Use the Exact Site
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
    "Referer": "https://assessmentonline.naac.gov.in/",  # Directly from the site
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Connection": "keep-alive"
}

Extra Tip: Checking Referer Requirements
1 ️⃣  Open Developer Tools (F12) in Chrome
2 ️⃣  Go to Network > Find the file you’re downloading
3 ️⃣  Check the Request Headers to see what Referer was used
4 ️⃣  Copy the Referer and add it to HEADERS
